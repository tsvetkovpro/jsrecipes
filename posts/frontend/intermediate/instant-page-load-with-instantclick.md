  <h4>When would I use this?</h4>
  If you want to improve page load performance, InstantClick essentially
  gives you a free speed boost by prefetching a page on link mouseover.

[InstantClick](http://instantclick.io/) is a JavaScript library that
dramatically speeds up your website, making navigation effectively instant in
most cases.

#### How it works
Before visitors click on a link, they hover over that link. Between these two
events, 200 ms to 300 ms usually pass by (test yourself here). InstantClick
makes use of that time to preload the page, so that the page is already there
when you click.
