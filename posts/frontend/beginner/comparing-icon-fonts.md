  <h4>When would I use this?</h4>
  If you need to improve usability by adding helpful icons in your web application.
  This site uses Font Awesome in various places.
</div>

If you are building a web application, you would almost certainly use icons at
some point, somewhere in your application.

If you have used Bootstrap 3+ then you might have seen their [Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/).
One advantage over fixed-size image-based icons of Bootstrap 2 is that these
font icons look good at any size, and since it's just a font, you can easily
change its color in CSS.

#### [Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
Official Bootstrap's icon font that comes pre-packaged in a zip file when you
download Bootstrap 3.

**Number of Icons**: 200

**License**: Free to use

**Font File Size**: 120 kB

The only good thing about Glyphicons is they are bundled with Bootstrap. But
compared to other fonts, it is just too limited to be useful, at least in my
case. Now, [Glyphicons Pro](glyphicons.com) (commercial version) on the other
hand is really nice, but you have to pay for it.

#### [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.github.io)
The iconic font designed for Bootstrap. Includes Sass and LESS support.

**Number of Icons**: 369

**License**: SIL OFL 1.1

**Font File Size**: 356 kB

Font Awesome is definitely my favorite icon font. It has a good number of icons
that cover most of my use cases. Their web page is nicely designed and they have
awesome documentation on how to integrate Font Awesome via CDN, LESS, Sass.
<hr>

#### [Elusive](http://shoestrap.org/downloads/elusive-icons-webfont/)
Another icon webfont designed for Bootstrap. Includes Sass and LESS support.

**Number of Icons**: 299

**License**: SIL OFL

**Font File Size**: 364 kB

Another nice icon font. Typically I use it only when I need certain icons that
I cannot get with Font Awesome or because that one particular icon looks nicer
in Elusive Icons set. I really dislike how they make it so hard to download
Elusive Icons in their redesigned UI by placing the actual download link all
the way in the bottom after scrolling past hundreds of icons.
It is so unintuitive that on multiple occasions I had to download Elusive
Icons directly from the GitHub Project.

<hr>

#### [Foundation](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3)
Iconic web font by ZURB who created Foundation CSS framework.

**Number of Icons**: 283

**License**: Free to use

**Font File Size**: 294 kB

I have encountered Foundation icon fonts only recently and I must say - I like
it a lot! Some icons look even better than that of Font Awesome and Elusive.
Definitely give it a try if you are not satisfied with other icon fonts. Or
use multiple fonts at once if you don't mind extra bandwidth overhead for your
users.

#### Final Words
I haven't included every icon font here, only the most popular. There are two
more icon fonts that are worth checking out, [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com)
and [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io), but unfortunately they include fonts
without a stylesheet, so you still have some work to do if you want it to work
similar to icon fonts above.

Also, take a look at [Fontrello](http://fontello.com). It allows you to select
only the icons you need from multiple icon fonts and generate a new icon font
with just those icons. This is especially significant when you are only using a
few icons from many different icon fonts. Fontrello allows you to select fonts
from:

- Custom SVG icons from your computer
- Fontelico
- Font Awesome
- Entypo
- Typicons
- Iconic
- Modern Pictograms
- Meteocons
- MFG Labs
- Maki
- Zocial
- Brandico
- Elusive
- Linecons
- Web Symbols
