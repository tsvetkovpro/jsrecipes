### Nodemon

Nodemon will watch the files in the directory that nodemon was started,
and if they change, it will automatically restart your node application.

Now, any time you make a change to `app.js` or to its dependent modules (e.g.
controllers, models, routes), nodemon will automatically restart the server, so
you don't have to. I can't recommend this module enough! With nodemon you
no longer have to press **CTRL + C**, **Up Arrow**, **Enter** hundred times a day
to restart the server every single time you make a small change in your app.
